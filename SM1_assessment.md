# Statistical Methods 1

The due date of the final project is Monday, 17th January 2021 **the same as Statistical Computing (SC) 1**. However, you are encouraged to discuss the final project ideas early with us (Myself and Anthony). We expect you to essentially finish all your assessments before Christmas holidays. 



See below for due dates of other assignments. 



As students preparing for PhD research in Computational Statistics and Data Science, you are expected to spend a considerable amount of your time learning things that are **not** directly assessed.
Examples of portfolio/report are available upon request. 


## 1 Personal portfolio (30%)



For SM1, there are six topics. Due dates of the portfolios are in the brackets. 

- Basics of Statistical Learning (due Fri, week 3)

- Probability Theory 

- Linear Methods for Regression (due Wed, week 6)

- Linear Methods for Classification (due Mon, week 8)

- Probabilistic Graphical Model (Bayesian Net and Markov Net) (due Mon, week 11)

- Advanced Topics in Machine Learning (due Mon, week 11)



For each topic, there should be a document submission (except the Probability Theory) typeset using Latex, discussing mathematical contents covered in the lectures. Each submission should be no more than 4 A4-pages using 11 point fonts, standard margin. 



## 2 Assessed coursework (40%)



On week 5 **and** week 9, two coursework will be given. These consist 

- multiple choices questions, 

- calculations and proofs. 



Each of the two submitted pieces of work will be worth 20%. Points will be awarded for correct answers to questions. 




## 3 Group project (30%)



There will be a joint project for Statistical Computing 1 and Statistical Methods 1. Below are general guidelines: 



Groups should have 2 or 3 members.



On provided (or self-prepared) datasets, you will need to

1. implement regression/classification algorithms covered in SM1

2. using computational skills covered in SC1, and

3. write a report explaining your methodology and presenting the performance of your method using statistical metrics.



As part of your project, you should create at least one documented and tested R package, and provide access to it via GitHub.



The computational aspects of the project will be assessed for your Statistical Computing 1 project mark and the methodological aspects will be assessed for your Statistical Methods 1 project mark.



## 4 SPECIFIC Guidelines for Statistical Methods 1 Report

Overall, the report should be written like an academic paper, typeset by Latex. You should NOT include programming code in the report. Use pseudo-code instead to explain your algorithm if necessary. 



The report should give sufficient technical details on

1. What statistical learning problem is attempted.

2. What statistical learning method is applied to solve the problem mentioned above. 

3. The mathematical details and derivations of the applied method/algorithm.

4. An explanation of experimental results, with plots/tables. 



 It is expected that all members of the group will contribute equally. If there are issues with this, the group should discuss the situation with the unit leads.



 **Criteria for assessment** will include



- Format and Style: does the report have a writing style of an academic paper. 

- Choice of material, i.e. relationship with the concepts taught in the unit.

- Clarity, i.e. are ideas/methods clearly communicated, are plots properly annotated with legible axis labels, legends etc. 

- The correctness of mathematics.

- The appropriate level of detail and rigour for the difficulty of the material.
